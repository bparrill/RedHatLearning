Files associated with performing Red Hat Learning Subscription Labs on a local system.

The Red Hat Learning environment provides 400 hours of online labs.  If you spend much time doing 
experimenting and exercises outside of the course itself you can consume those hours fairly quickly.
In an effort to save lab hours and gain more experience I set up local environments when possible.

These notes and files may or may not be useful to you if you are wanting to do the same thing.
