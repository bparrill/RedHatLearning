# RedHatLearning
Files associated with performing Red Hat Learning Subscription Labs on a local system.

The Red Hat Learning environment provides 400 hours of online labs.  If you spend much time doing 
experimenting and exercises outside of the course itself you can consume those hours fairly quickly.
In an effort to save lab hours and gain more experience I set up local environments when possible.

Note: Many of these instructions replace Red Hat with CentOS files.  My access to Red Hat files is
via an internal Red Hat Satellite server which requires VPN access.  However, the server I do the
testing on is not on the internal network and does not have VPN access, so the Red Hat images
unfortuately cannot be registered.

These notes and files may or may not be useful to you if you are wanting to do the same thing.
