# RH134 - Red Hat System Administration II
Several of the labs can be run from a local install of RHEL or CentOS.  This not only 
saves online lab time but allows greater flexibility in experimenting and getting
hands-on experience.

These instructions assume you have a base RHEL or CentOS system installed.  I
recommend using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to install 
an OS which can be saved or deleted as needed.

Be sure to create a shared folder with your VM so you can copy files between the
host and the VM.

## Chapter 1 - Improving Command-line Productivity
Bash shell scripts are files with sequences of commands.  First line should be:

```
#!/bin/bash
```

* 'Escaping' characters suppresses their special meaning.  Ie, `\#`, `\"`, etc
* Single quotes (`'xxx'`) preserve literal meaning of characters
* Double quotes (`"xxx"`) suppress globbing and shell expansion, allow command and variable substitution
* `echo text` - displays output
* `exit #` - exits script with exit code.  Use `$?` to access exit code
* Operators may be used to check for conditions.  See `man test` for list
* [ <expression> ] - test command, ie: `[1 -eq 1]; echo $?`
* [[ <expression> ]] - extended test, adds glob pattern and regex pattern matching
* Regular expressions: `man 7 regex`

For loop:

```
for <variable> in <list>; do
   <commands>
done
```

Examples:

```
for NUM in num1 num2 num3; do echo $NUM; done
for NUM in num{1..3}; do echo $NUM; done
for NUM in $(seq 2 2 10); do echo "$NUM"; done
```

If/then:

```
if <condition>; then
   <commands>
elif <condition>; then
   <commands>
else 
   <commands>   
fi
```

Regular expressions:

* `^` and `$` - anchors beginning and end of line
* `.` - wildcard matches any character
* `[xyz]` - matches x, y, or z
* `*` - matches zero or more of the previous expression
* `\{x\}` - matches previous expression x number of times
* Usually enclose in single quotes so shell doesn't interpret metacharacters
* `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `vim`, `less`, etc - can use regex

Commands to know:
* `which <file>` - shows path and file which will be executed
* `grep` - searches for text pattern (regex).  `-i` - ignore case.  `-v` - lines not matching

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  
The section 4 lab has you ssh to different hosts.  To run the command as-is you may need a second VM.  
The section 6 lab assumes the `postfix` package was installed today.  To install the package: `yum -y install postfix`.  Start the postfix service: `systemctl start postfix`.

## Chapter 2 - Scheduling Future Tasks

Commands to know:

* `at <time>` - schedule command to run at certain time.  Takes input from STDIN, Ctrl+D to end.  Time may be given in several formats: `now +5min`, `noon +4 days`, `5pm august 3 2020`.  See `/usr/share/doc/at/timespec`
* `at -q <letter> <time>` - runs the job with priority `<letter>`.  a - highest, z - lowest
* `atq` - shows queued jobs
* `at -c #` - shows commands being executed for job #
* `atrm #` - removes job # from queue

* `crontab` - manages recurring jobs for user. `-r` - removes jobs.  `-l` - list jobs. `-e` - edit jobs
* crontab fields appear in the following order: `Minutes Hours Day_of_Month Month Day_of_Week Command`.  Syntax rules:
   * `*` - run always
   * For weekdays, 0 - Sunday, 1 - Monday . . .
   * `x-y` - sets range, inclusive
   * `x,y` - for lists.  Lists can include ranges
   * `*/x` - interval of `x`
   * Three-letter abbreviations for month and weekeday. `Mon`.  `Jan`

System-wide crontab defined in either `/etc/crontab` or files placed in `/etc/cron.d` directory.  Similar format to above except a user name is placed before the command.  
Scripts (not `crontab` files) may also be placed in the `/etc/cron.hourly`, `/etc/cron.daily`, `/etc/cron.weekly`, and `/etc/cron.monthly` directories.  These are run using the `/etc/cron.d/0hourly` (for hourly) and `/etc/anacrontab` (for all others).

Scheduling may also use `systemd` timer units.  Timer units may activate another unit time (like a service) when the unit name matches the timer unit name.  Modifications to the default profiles in `/usr/lib/systemd/system` should be placed in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory.  After a change run: `systemctl daemon-reload`, then `systemctl enable --now <unitname.timer>`.

Temporary files:

Creation and cleanup handled by `systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer`.  View config file with: `systemctl cat systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer`.

Manual cleanup is done using `systemd-tmpfiles --clean`.  See `man 5 tmpfiles.d` for details on the config file format.  Configuration files are:

* `/etc/tmpfiles.d/*.conf` - custom files go here
* `/run/tmpfiles.d/*.conf` - volitile
* `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf` - provided by system, do not edit

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.

## Chapter 3 - Tuning System Performance

Commands to know:

* `tuned-adm active` - display active profile
* `tuned-adm list` - list profiles
* `tuned-adm profile <profile>` - switch to new profile
* `tuned-adm recommend` - show recommended profile
* `tuned-adm off` - turns off tuning

_Nice_ levels range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).

* `top` - Nice values shown in `NI` column.  Sheduled priority shown in `PR` column
* `ps axo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice`
* `ps -o pid,comm,nice <pid_num>` - shows nice level for specified PID

* `nice <command>` - by default starts process with nice level of 10
* `nice -n xx <command>` - starts process with nice level of `xx`
* `renice -n xx <pid_num>` - changes nice level of PID
* `top` - renice process using `r` option

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  
Before starting the chapter 3 section 5 lab, start two processes:

```
md5sum /dev/zero &
sha1sum /dev/zero &
```

## Chapter 4 - Controlling Access to Files with ACLs

Commands to know:

* `ls -l` - shows `+` at end of permission string if ACLs set
* `getfacl fn` - display ACLs on fn

ACL mask defines maximum permissions for named users, group owner, and named groups.  Does not apply to file owner or other users.

* `setfacl -m u:name:rX file` - Modifies ACL for user `name`.  If `name` is blank applies to owner
* `setfacl -m g:group:rw file` - Modifies ACL for group `group`.  If `group` is blank applies to group owner
* `setfacl -m o::- file` - Modifies ACL for other users.  In this case, no permissions
* `getfacl fn | setfacl --set-file=- fn2` - Sets ACL on `fn2` to be the same as `fn1`
* `setfacl -m m::r file` - Sets ACL mask
* `setfacl -R -m u:name:rX dir` - Recursivly set ACL on directories
* `setfacl -x u:name,g:name file` - Removes ACL for specified user/group
* `setfacl -b file` - Removes all ACLs for file
* `setfacl -m d:u:name:rx dir` - Sets the default ACLs on a directory - used for inheritance

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.

#### Section 4 Lab
For section 4 lab, create the users and groups (switch to root first):

```
for USER in sysadmin1 operator1 consultant1 consultant2;do adduser $USER;done
for USER in sysadmin1 operator1 consultant1 consultant2;do passwd $USER;done
groupadd operators
groupadd consultants
usermod -aG operators sysadmin1
usermod -aG consultants consultant1
usermod -aG consultants consultant2
mkdir -p /shares/content/server-info
chgrp -R operators /shares
chmod -R g+s /shares
```

Set up the sample files used in the lab.  First, create a script file called `/shares/content/loadavg.sh` with the following:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo '#################################################'
hostname
echo '#################################################'
date
echo '#################################################'
cat /proc/loadavg
echo '#################################################'
```

Then run the following commands:

```
chmod +x /shares/content/loadavg.sh
/shares/content/loadavg.sh > /shares/content/serverb-loadavg.txt
```

#### Section 5 Lab
Create the users and groups necessary.  As root:

```
for USER in manager{1..2} contractor{1..3};do adduser $USER;done
for USER in manager{1..2} contractor{1..3};do passwd $USER;done
groupadd managers
groupadd contractors
for USER in contractor{1..3};do usermod -aG contractors $USER;done
for USER in manager{1..2};do usermod -aG managers $USER;done
mkdir -p /shares/cases
touch /shares/cases/shortlist.txt
touch /shares/cases/backlog.txt
```

## Chapter 5 - Managing SELinux Security
SELinux has three operating modes:

| Enforcing  | Enforces all rules
| Permissive | Doesn't enforce, but provides warnings
| Disabled   | Turned off

SELinux contexts have the following format:

```
system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0  /var/www/html
-------- -------- ------------------- --
 User      Role        Type           Level
```

Commands to know:

* `ls -Z` - Displays SELinux context
* `-Z` also works with `ps`, `cp`, `mkdir`, etc
* `ps axZ` - Displays context for processes

* `getenforce` - Displays current SELinux mode
* `setenforce [ Enforcing | Permissive | 1 | 0 ]` - Sets mode

See also the `/etc/selinux/config` file.

Changing contexts:

* `chcon -t <context_type> <fn>` - Changes context of `fn` to context type.  Not saved in SELinux context database
* `restorecon -v <fn>` - Restores context to default value
* `semanage fcontext` - Updates context databases.  `restorecon` uses this value when run.  `-a` adds, `-d` deletes, `-l` lists

* `semanage fcontext -l` - Lists all default rules 
* `restorecon -Rv <dir>` - Recursively restores contexts. `-F` forces reset

Install the SELinux policy documentation:

```
yum -y install selinux-policy-doc
man -k '_selinux'
```

SELinux booleans:

* `getsebool -a` - Lists current values
* `setsebool <boolean> <on|off>` - Sets a boolean value.  `-P` writes pending value to policy.  Needed for persistence
* `semanage boolean -l` - Lists booleans, state, default value, and description
* `semanage boolean -l -C` - Lists booleans where state and default are different

Troubleshooting:

* Audit log is `/var/log/audit/audit.log`
* Messages stored in `/var/log/messages`
* `sealert -l UUID` - Provides more readable info on error.  UUID is shown in `messages` file
* `ausearch -m AVC -ts recent` - Searches `audit.log` file.  `-m` is message type.  `-ts` searches based on time

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  Be sure to make a backup of `httpd.conf` before making changes.

If Apache isn't installed:

```
yum -y install httpd
```

By default port 80 for `http` access will not be open in the firewall.  To open the port:

```
firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

At the start of the section 8 lab, the `index.html` file may already have the appropriate permissions.  To reset:

```
echo 'This is a new index file.' > ~/index.html
rm /var/www/html/index.html
mv ~/index.html /var/www/html
```

Setup for the section 9 lab is similar to what was done earlier with the `/custom` directory, but this time create `/lab-content`.

## Chapter 6 - Managing Basic Storage
*Master Boot Record* - MBR - is the old way of partitioning.  Max of 4 primary partitions, and max of 15 total partitions using extended partitions.  Max disk/partition size is 2 TiB.  
*GUID Partition Table* - GPT - provides up to 128 partitions and supports disks/partitions up to 8 ZiB.  Also maintains backup partition table at end of disk.

`parted` manages both MBR and GPT schemes.  _*Changes are written immediately.  Use with caution!*_

* `parted /dev/sda print` - shows current partitions on device.  Partition Table of type `msdos` is MBR.
* `parted /dev/sda` - no parameters opens `parted` in interactive session
* `parted /dev/sda unit [s|B|MiB|GiB|TiB|MB|GB|TB] print` - shows size in sectors, bytes, etc
* `parted /dev/sda mklabel msdos` - labels disk as MBR.  Wipes current table!
* `parted /dev/sda mklabel gpt` - labels disk as GPT.  Wipes current table!
* `parted /dev/sda help mkpart` - lists supported file-system types

Create MBR partition:

1. `parted /dev/sda` - open interactive session for disk
1. `mkpart`, then `primary` or `extended` - to create primary or extended partition
1. `xfs`, or whichever file system to be used
1. Specify start and end.  By default `MB` is used,  use `s` for sector, etc.  Best to start with a sector which is a multiple of 2048.  Size can't be specified directly, but size = end - start
1. Partition will be created immediately after specifying end.  Use `quit` to exit
1. `udevadm settle` - waits for system to detect new partition and create device under `/dev`

May also be specified on a single line:

```
parted /dev/sda mkpart primary xfs 2048s 20GiB
```

Create GPT partition:

1. `parted /dev/sda` - open interactive session for disk
1. `mkpart`, then provide partition name
1. `xfs`, or whichever file system to be used
1. Specify start and end.  By default `MB` is used,  use `s` for sector, etc.  Best to start with a sector which is a multiple of 2048.  Size can't be specified directly, but size = end - start
1. Partition will be created immediately after specifying end.  Use `quit` to exit
1. `udevadm settle` - waits for system to detect new partition and create device under `/dev`

May also be specified on a single line:

```
parted /dev/sda mkpart mydata xfs 2048s 20GiB
```

Delete partition:

1. `parted /dev/sda` - open interactive session for disk
1. `print` - print partition table.  Each partition will have a partition number
1. `rm #` - removes partition `#`
1. `quit` - to exit interactive session

Create file system:

* `mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1` - to create file system on device.  Other file systems also supported in similar manner

Mount file system:

* `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt` - to mount the new drive onto directory `/mnt`  
* `mount` - with no parameters to see status of current mounts
* `/etc/fstab` - file used to automatically mount file systems
* `systemctl daemon-reload` - after making changes to `fstab`
* `lsblk --fs` - lists block devices, shows UUID and mount points

`fstab` format:

```
UUID=b2afe8f9-b17f-45fb-a47f-413944d034ce /boot   xfs    defaults  0 0
----------------------------------------- -----   ----   --------  - -
   UUID or device name                    mount   fstype  options  used by dump and fsck
                                          point
```

Swap space is stored in a special partition - `linux-swap`.  It should be sized appropriately, especially if the computer
uses hibernation since all memory is stored to disk.  

* Follow process above for creating a GPT partition, but make it type `linux-swap`.  
* `mkswap /dev/sdc1` - to format swap area
* `swapon /dev/sdc1` - to activate the swap area
* `free` - shows free memory and swap size
* `swapoff /dev/sdc1` - deactivates swap area
* `swapon --show` - Displays swap areas currently activated
* `swapon -a` - Enables all swap partitions defined in `fstab`

Use `fstab` to make persistent:

```
UUID=b107bba0-dfd1-4e92-97fe-e52fb2dc38d3 swap  swap    defaults        0 0
```

Priority may also be set in the `fstab` file.  Ie, `pri=4` where the options keywords are specified.  Default priority is -2.



### Labs
You will want to create some extra virtual drives in order to practice creating partitions and file systems.  This can usually easily been done using your VirtualBox or other virtualization software's interface.  With VirtualBox you can also create
one [from the command line](https://wspstech.blogspot.com/2020/01/create-virtualbox-hard-drive-from.html).

Use the `lsblk --fs` command to list devices.  Your new drive should not have a file system yet.  In this example there are
two new devices - `sdb` and `sdc`:

```
[ansible@ansible3 ~]$ lsblk --fs
NAME        FSTYPE      LABEL          UUID                                   MOUNTPOINT
sda                                                                           
├─sda1      ext4                       6dd3ee35-ab58-40a0-a3f7-3d3b0ac28ad3   /boot
└─sda2      LVM2_member                Ctid4m-z8tK-GRah-eGFo-2Dhk-jLrO-mZoniG 
  ├─cl-root xfs                        850f2d8b-067d-49fb-802b-433147738ce5   /
  └─cl-swap swap                       e7531c73-d072-41bc-b768-3a19d153cedc   [SWAP]
sdb                                                                           
sdc
```

`parted -l` will also show these devices having an "unrecognized disk label."

## Chapter 7 - Managing Logical Volumes
