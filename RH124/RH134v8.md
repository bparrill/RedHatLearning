# RH134 - Red Hat System Administration II
Several of the labs can be run from a local install of RHEL or CentOS.  This not only 
saves online lab time but allows greater flexibility in experimenting and getting
hands-on experience.

These instructions assume you have a base RHEL or CentOS system installed.  I
recommend using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to install 
an OS which can be saved or deleted as needed.

Be sure to create a shared folder with your VM so you can copy files between the
host and the VM.

## Chapter 1 - Improving Command-line Productivity
Bash shell scripts are files with sequences of commands.  First line should be:

```
#!/bin/bash
```

* 'Escaping' characters suppresses their special meaning.  Ie, `\#`, `\"`, etc
* Single quotes (`'xxx'`) preserve literal meaning of characters
* Double quotes (`"xxx"`) suppress globbing and shell expansion, allow command and variable substitution
* `echo text` - displays output
* `exit #` - exits script with exit code.  Use `$?` to access exit code
* Operators may be used to check for conditions.  See `man test` for list
* [ <expression> ] - test command, ie: `[1 -eq 1]; echo $?`
* [[ <expression> ]] - extended test, adds glob pattern and regex pattern matching
* Regular expressions: `man 7 regex`

For loop:

```
for <variable> in <list>; do
   <commands>
done
```

Examples:

```
for NUM in num1 num2 num3; do echo $NUM; done
for NUM in num{1..3}; do echo $NUM; done
for NUM in $(seq 2 2 10); do echo "$NUM"; done
```

If/then:

```
if <condition>; then
   <commands>
elif <condition>; then
   <commands>
else 
   <commands>   
fi
```

Regular expressions:

* `^` and `$` - anchors beginning and end of line
* `.` - wildcard matches any character
* `[xyz]` - matches x, y, or z
* `*` - matches zero or more of the previous expression
* `\{x\}` - matches previous expression x number of times
* Usually enclose in single quotes so shell doesn't interpret metacharacters
* `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `vim`, `less`, etc - can use regex

Commands to know:
* `which <file>` - shows path and file which will be executed
* `grep` - searches for text pattern (regex).  `-i` - ignore case.  `-v` - lines not matching

## Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  
The section 4 lab has you ssh to different hosts.  To run the command as-is you may need a second VM.  
The section 6 lab assumes the `postfix` package was installed today.  To install the package: `yum -y install postfix`.  Start the postfix service: `systemctl start postfix`.
