# RH124 v8 - Red Hat System Administration I
Several of the labs can be run from a local install of RHEL or CentOS.  This not only 
saves online lab time but allows greater flexibility in experimenting and getting
hands-on experience.

These instructions assume you have a base RHEL or CentOS system installed.  I
recommend using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to install 
an OS which can be saved or deleted as needed.

Be sure to create a shared folder with your VM so you can copy files between the
host and the VM.

## Chapter 2 - Accessing the Command Line

Commands to know:
* `Ctrl+Alt+F2-F6` can be used to cycle through consoles.  `Ctrl+Alt+F1` returns to main console / graphical desktop
* `Super+M` opens the message tray.  `Super` is often the Windows key on PCs
* `Ctrl+Alt+UpArrow` and `Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow` can switch between workspaces
* `Super+L` locks screen
* `Super` twice and hold opens Activities overview
* `Ctrl+Alt+Del` powers off or restarts the system (doesn't work in a VirtualBox environment)
* `ssh user@host` to remotely log in to a remote system. Use `-i mykey.pem` to specify private key file
* `exit` to exit a session

* `passwd` to change your password
* `;` is used to separate commands on a single line
* `whoami` shows currently logged in user
* `date` shows date/time info.  Use `+%R` for time, `+%x` for date
* `file <fn>` to view the type of file
* `cat <fn>` views contents of file
* `head <fn>` to view the beginning of a file, use `-n <num>` to display num lines
* `tail <fn>` to view the end of a file, use `-n <num>` to display num lines
* `wc <fn>` to perform a word count on a file.  Use `-l`, `-w`, or `-c` to count lines, words, or characters
* `<tab>` once completes argument, twice shows available options
* `\` at end of line allows command continuation on another line
* `history` shows command history
* `!` runs prevous command.  `!<num>` runs command from history corresponding to num.  `!<str>` runs most
recent command starting with string text

### `bash` command line editing shortcuts
* `Ctrl+a` - Jump to beginning of command line
* `Ctrl+e` - Jump to end of command line
* `Ctrl+u` - Clear from cursor to beginning of command line
* `Ctrl+k` - Clear from cursor to end of command line
* `Ctrl+LeftArrow` - Jump to beginning of previous word
* `Ctrl+RightArrow` - Jump to end of next word
* `Ctrl+r` - Search history for pattern
* `Esc+.` - copies last argument from previous command
* `Alt+.` - like above but allows for cycling through previous commands
More commands are [listed here](http://teohm.com/blog/shortcuts-to-move-faster-in-bash-command-line/)

### Labs
Labs can be run mostly as-is.  If you want to create a user named `student`, run the following
commands (assumes currently logged in user has admin authority):
```
sudo adduser student
sudo passwd student
```
Enter `student` for the password twice.  You may receive a warning about a short password.  
If you want `student` to be able to issue admin commands:
```
sudo usermod -aG wheel student
```

The `zcat` file can be found in the `/usr/bin` directory.  


## Chapter 3 - Managing Files from the Command Line
Important directories:
* `/` - System root directory
* `/usr` - Installed software and static data:
  * `/usr/bin` - User commands
  * `/usr/sbin` - System admin commands
  * `/usr/local` - Locally customized software
* `/etc` - Configuration files
* `/var` - Variable, persistent data (logs, web content, databases, etc)
* `/run` - Runtime data, not persistent
* `/home` - User home directories
* `/root` - Root's home directory
* `/tmp` - Temporary files, deleted automatically after certain period
* `/boot` - System boot files
* `/dev` - Device files

Use `man hier` to see a list of directories.

Relative directories:

* `..` - Previous (parent) directory
* `~` - Current user's home directory, use `~username` for a user's home directory

Commands to know:
* `pwd` - Display current working directory
* `ls` - List files, use `-l` to get more details, `-a` to include hidden files, `-R` to recurse directories
* `cd <dir>` - Change current working directory.  If `<dir>` not specified switches to user's home directory. `cd -` switches to previous working directory
* `touch <fn>` - Update a file's timestamp without otherwise modifying it.  Can also be used to create empty files

File management commands:
* `cp <fn1> <fn2>` - Copy file fn1 to fn2, use `-r` to recurse directories
* `mv <fn1> <fn2>` - Move file (or directory) fn1 to fn2, can also be used to rename files
* `rm <fn>` - Remove (delete) file or directory, use `-r` to recurse directories, `-f` to not prompt for confirmation
* `mkdir <dir>` - Create new directory.  Use `-p` to create multiple levels at once
* `rmdir <dir>` - Remove empty directory

Link commands:
* `ln <fn1> <fn2>` - Creates hard link `fn2` from file `fn1`
* `ls -il` shows inode number of file.  Hard links have same inode number
* `ln -s` - creates symbolic link

Command Line Pattern matching (globbing):
* `*` - Any string (0+ characters)
* `?` - Single character
* `~+` - Current working directory
* `~-` - Previous working directory
* `[abc...]` - Any one character from list
* `[!abc...]` - Any one character not from list (also `[^abc...]`)
* `[[:alpha:]]`, `[[:lower:]]`, `[[:upper:]]`, `[[:alnum:]]`, `[[:punc:]]`, `[[:digit:]]`, `[[:space:]]`

Brace expansion:
Use `{}` to generate list of strings:
* `{1..5}` or `{a..e}` - sequences
* `{a,b,c}` - list

Variable expansion:  
* `VARNAME=value` to set the value of a variable
* `$VARNAME` or `${VARNAME}` to reference the variable

Command substitution:
* `$(command)` or ```command``` - Output of `command` is inserted into command string.  Backtick method not recommended
* `\` - Escape character
* `'single quotes'` - Interpret all text literally
* `"double quotes"` - Interpret text literally but still allow command substitution

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.

## Chapter 4 - Getting Help in RHEL

## Chapter 5 - Creating, Viewing, and Editing Text Files
Channels:
* *0* - stdin
* *1* - stdout
* *2* - stderr

Redirection:
* `>filename` - redirects output to filename (overwriting if exists)
* `>>filename` - redirects output to filename (appending if exists)
* `2>filename` - redirects stderr to filename
* `2>/dev/null` - discards stderr output
* `>filename 2>&1` or `&>filename` - redirects both stdout and stderr to same file
* `command1 | command2` - pipes stdout from command1 to stdin to command2

Use `tee` to save to file and pipe, ie:
```
ls -l | tee /myfile | less
```

Editing:
`vim` cheat sheet is [available here](https://vim.rtorr.com/).

Shell environment:
* `VARNAME=value` - to set the value of a variable
* `$VARNAME` or `${VARNAME}` - to reference the variable
* `set` - shows all variables
* `export VARNAME` - makes `VARNAME` an environment variable available to both shell and programs
* `export VARNAME=value` - set and export in one line
* `unset VARNAME` - removes variable, also unexports
* `export -n VARNAME` - removes environment variable without unsetting it

Common environment variables:
* `PS1` - sets the command prompt
* `PATH` - sets the path
* `EDITOR` - sets default editor

Set variables automatically by editing `~/.bashrc` file

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.

## Chapter 6 - Managing Local Users & Groups

Commands to know:
* `id` - shows info about current user
* `ps` - view process info, use option `a` for all processes and `u` to view user info
* `ls -l` - long directory listing showing user/group info

* `su - username` - Switch to user, `-` sets up user's environment.  If no username
specifed *root* is assumed
* `sudo <command>` - Run command using root access
* `sudo -i` - Start root account shell

User / Group commands:
* `useradd <username>` - create a new user
* `usermod` - modifies user.  See `--help` for options
* `userdel <username>` - removes user.  Use `-r` to remove home directory
* `passwd <username>`  - to set password

* `groupadd <group>` - adds a group, `-g` specifies GID, `-r` creates system group
* `groupmod` - modifies group.  See help
* `groupdel <group>` - removes group.  Group can't be primary group for any user
* `usermod -g <group> <user>` - change primary group for user
* `usermod -aG <group> <user>` - adds a supplementary group to a user

* `chage` - used to change password expiry rules.  See `--help` for parameters
  * `date` command can be helpful.  Ie, `date -d "+45 days"`
  * `chage -d 0 <user>` to force password change at first login

* `usermod -s /sbin/nologin <userid>` - For a user with no shell

`/etc/passwd` contains user information.  Despite file name, no passwords.  Sample entry:
```
bill:x:1000:1000:Bill:/home/bill:/bin/bash
```
Fields are:
```
username:dummy password:UID:Primary GID:User's real name:Home directory:Shell
```
`/etc/group` contains group information.  Sample entry:
```
wheel:x:10:bill,student
```
Fields are:
```
Groupname:Dummy password:GID:List of users (comma separated)
```

UID ranges:
* 0 - root
* 1-200 - system users assigned by Red Hat
* 201-999 - unprivileged system users, no file ownership
* 1000+ - regular users

`/etc/shadow` stores password information.  Sample entry:
```
bill:$6$lOopA.bs...opo4h4yY/::0:99999:7:::
```
Fields are:
```
username:Encrypted password:Last changed date:Min days before change (0 no min):Max days:Warning days:Days active after expiration:expiration date:reserved
```

`/etc/login.defs` is a configuration file for default user creation settings

### `root`
`root` is the superuser.  Generally not advised to log in as root.  You may run commands
as root in various ways:

* `su -` - start root command shell.  Need to know root's password
* `sudo <command>` - runs a command as root.  Log in with user's password.  Using `sudo`:
  * Don't need `root`'s password
  * Permissions stored in `/etc/sudoers` file
  * Commands logged in `/var/log/secure`
  * Members of group `wheel` have permission by default
  * To edit permissions, run `visudo`
  * `-i` option sets up target user environment

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  If you want to create a user named `operator1`, run the following
commands (assumes currently logged in user has admin authority):
```
sudo adduser operator1
sudo passwd operator1
sudo usermod -aG wheel operator1
```

## Chapter 7 - Controlling Access to Files
Permissions:  

| Permission | On File | On Directory |
| :------: |:----| :-----|
| r | Read file | Directory can be listed |
| w | Change file | Files may be created/deleted |
| x | Execute as command | Contents may be accessed |

Use long directory list to see permissions: `ls -l`.  
* 1st character:
  * `-` - regular file
  * `d` - directory
  * `l` - symbolic link
* Next 9 characters, three groups of three showing permissions
for owner, group, and all other users

`chmod` changes permissions on files/directories.  Two forms:
1. Symbolic: `chmod WhoWhatWhich filename` where:
  * *Who* is [u, g, o, a] for [user, group, other, all]
  * *What* is [+, -, =] for [add, remove, set exactly]
  * *Which* is [r, w, x] for see above table
  * USe `X` to set `x` on directories only.  Used with `-R` option to
  recurse directories
2. Numeric: `chmod ### filename` where:
  * Each digit represents access level: user,group,other
  * Sum of r=4, w=2, x=1

`chown` changes ownership of files/directories.  
```
chown user:group file
```
Use `-R` to make a change recursively.

`chgrp` can be used to change group.

`umask` views or sets default permissions:
* Bits cause corresponding permissions to be unset
* With no parameters the current umask is shown
* System default umask defined in `/etc/profile` and `/etc/bashrc`
* User default umask defined in `~/.bashrc` and `~/bash_profile`

### Special permissions
* `u+s` - Executes as owner of file, not current user (no effect on directory)
* `g+s` - Executes as group of file, not current user.  For directory, new files have group
ownership matching that of directory
* `o+t` - (No effect on files).  Users can only remove their own files.
Set numerically with 4th digit on `chmod` command (setuid = 4; setgid = 2; sticky = 1)

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  Sample users and groups may need to be created first.

## Chapter 8 - Monitoring and Managing Processes
States:
* `R` - TASK_RUNNING
* `S` - TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE (waiting for condition)
* `D` - TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, sleeping but will not respond to signals
* `K` - TASK_KILLABLE, similar to `D` but can be killed
* `T` - TASK_STOPPED, suspended, or TASK_TRACED, suspended for debug operations
* `Z` - EXIT_ZOMBIE
* `X` - EXIT_DEAD

`ps` command lists current processes.  Three options:
* UNIX (POSIX) options preceded by `-`
* BSD otions no dash
* GNU long options preceded by `--`

* `ps aux` - `a` lists all processes (not just current user), `u` user oriented format, `x` not use processes with a tty terminal
* `ps lax` - `l` long format
* `ps -ef` - `-e` lists all processes, `-f` full-format listing

`top` command shows live view of processes.  Press `h` or `?` to see list of commands

* `<command> &` to start job in background
* `jobs` to list jobs running
* `fg %<num>` to bring job to foreground
* To put current job in background:
  1. Press Ctrl+z to put in background and suspend
  2. `bg %<num>` to resume the job
* `ps j` shows job related process info

Signals interrupt processes.  Signal numbers can be found:

## Chapter 9 - Controlling Services and Daemons
Unit types:  
* `.service` - system services
* `.socket` - socket for interprocess communications (IPC)
* `.path` - delay activation until system change

`systemctl` interacts with units:  
* `systemctl -t help` - list all units.
* `systemctl list-units --type=service` - show all loaded service units. `--all` shows all units
* `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service` - show unit files
* `systemctl status <unit>` - show status of a unit
* `systemctl is-active <unit>` - verify unit is active (running)
* `systemctl is-enabled <unit>` - verify unit is enabled (starts on boot)
* `systemctl is-failed <unit>` - verify unit failed during startup
* `systemctl --failed --type=service` - shows all failed services

* `systemctl start <unit>` - starts a unit.  `.service` is the default service type
* `systemctl stop <unit>` - stop a unit
* `systemctl restart <unit>` - stops & restarts a unit.  Unit receives new PID
* `systemctl reload <unit>` - reloads unit configuration (does not get a new PID)
* `systemctl reload-or-restart <unit>` - restarts if reload isn't available
* `systemctl list-dependencies <unit>` - lists unit dependencies.  `--reverse` lists units dependent on target
* `systemctl mask <unit>` - masks unit, prevents from starting.  Use `unmask` to reverse
* `systemctl enable <unit>` - unit starts at boot time.  Use `disable` to reverse

## Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  
The lab in section 4 uses `chronyd`.  By default this may not be started nor enabled on your CentOS system.  

## Chapter 10 - Configuring and Securing SSH
You will want to have at least one other system to test with.  Either install one from scratch or clone 
your existing system.  If you clone a system, be sure to give it a new host name.  To specify a new host
name:  
```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new.host.name>
```

`ssh` is used to remotely log into another system:
* `ssh <remotehost>` - remotely logs in using current user name
* `ssh <user@remotehost>` - remotely logs in using a different user name
* `ssh <user@remotehost> <command>` - runs `<command>` on remote hosts and disconnects

Communication is secured using public key encryption.  Server sends public key to client before
client logs in.  Known hosts stored in:
* `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` - for system-wide configuration
* `~/.ssh/known-hosts` - for user level

Format of file:
```
remotehost,ip_address encryption_algorithm public_key
```

Public key on server stored in the `/etc/ssh` directory with extension `.pub`.

To allow authentication without passwords, use key-based authentication.  On the client:
* `ssh-keygen` - generate public/private key pair.  `-f filename` optionally sets output file names
* Default files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`
* Set permission 600 on private key and 644 on public key
* `ssh-copy-id -i <public_key> user@remotehost` - send public key to remote server
* `ssh -i <private_key> user@remotehost` - to log in.  Omit `-i` to use default key
* `eval $(ssh-agent)` - starts agent which remembers passphrase (if used)
* `ssh-add <private_key>` - adds passphrase to `ssh-agent`.  Omit file to use default key

On the server:
* Daemon is called `sshd`
* Configuration file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
* `PermitRootLogin` - allows or denies root login through ssh. `yes`, `no`, or `without-password`
* `PasswordAuthentication` - set to `no` forces only private key-based login
* `systemctl reload sshd` - to activate configuration changes

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  You may want to create the `production1` and `production2` users on each system.

## Chapter 11 - Analyzing and Storing Logs
### Logging
Logs are usually kept in the `/var/log` directory.  Logging services include `systemd-journald` and `rsyslog`.

Syslog priorities:  

| Code | Priority | Severity |
| :---: | :------- | :------- |
| 0    | emerg    | System is unusable |
| 1    | alert    | Action must be taken immediately |
| 2    | crit     | Critical condition |
| 3    | err      | Non-critical error condition |
| 4    | warning  | Warning condition |
| 5    | notice   | Normal but significant event |
| 6    | info     | Informational event |
| 7    | debug    | Debugging-level message |

`rsyslog` configured using `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and `.conf` files located in `/etc/rsyslog.d` directory.

`logrotate` is used to rotate log files.

Syslog log files have the following format:
```
Time_stamp Host Program_name[PID] Message
Jan 23 07:35:54 centos8 sudo[15494]: pam_unix(sudo:session): session closed for user root
```
Use `tail -f <logfilename>` to monitor a log file.

Send messages to `rsyslog` manually using the `logger` command:
```
logger -p <facility> "Message text"
logger -p local7.notice "Log entry created on host"
```

`systemd-journald` stores journal in `/run/log`.   Non-persistent by default.
* `journalctl` - View entries in journal file.  `-n` only show last 10 log entries
* `journalctl -n <num>` - Show last n log entries
* `journalctl -f` - Like `tail -f`, live display of journal entries
* `journalctl -p err` - Shows only error and higher
* `journalctl --since today` - Shows entries since specified time/date, "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss", "-1 hour", etc
* `journalctl --until yesterday` - Shows entries before time.  Can be used with `--since`
* `man 7 systemd.time` for more details on specifying a time/date
* `journalctl -o verbose` - displays additional fields
* `journalctl <filter>` - filters messages.  `journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service _PID=1182`
* `man 7 systemd.journal-fields` for details on fields
* `journalctl -b <num>` - view entries for boot `<num>`.  Omit `<num>` for current boot.  Can be negative

Configuration is `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`.  Change `Storage` to make journal persistent.

### Time
Accurate time is important for logs, especially across multiple systems.

* `timedatectl` - Time related settings
* `timedatectl list-timezones` - database of available time zones
* `timedatectl set-timezone <timezone>` - sets the time zone
* `tzselect` - guided method for finding correct timezone
* `timedatectl set-time "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"` - sets current date/time.  Either may be omitted
* `timedatectl set-ntp true` - Enables NTP sync.  Also `false` to disable.  Uses `chronyd`
* Configuration file: `/etc/chrony.conf`
* `systemctl restart chronyd` - after making changes
* `chronyc sources -v` - checks system is working

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  However, the lab NTP server will not be available.  

## Chapter 12 - Manage Networking
TCP/IP network model layers:

* Application - application-specific protocols like http, ssh, SMTP, etc
* Transport - TCP and UDP
* Internet - Network layer, IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
* Link - provides connection to physical layer, such as Ethernet or WLAN

Network interface naming:

* Starts with:
   * en - Ethernet
   * wl - WLAN
   * ww - WWAN
* Rest of name based on firmware or location in PCI topology:
   * oN - on board device
   * sN - PCI hotplug
   * pMsN - PCI device on bus M slot N

IPv4 is 32-bit number represented in decimal as four 8-bit octets (0-255).  Two parts: network and host.  All hosts on same subnet can communicate without router - same network part.  Netmask identifies how many bits of address belong to subnet. Represented as `255.255.255.0` or newer syntax `/24`.  Example:

```
IP Address: 10.0.0.5             = 00001010.00000000.00000000.00000101
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24) = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
                                   -------------------------- --------
                                               Network           Host
```

IPv6 is a 128-bit number represented by 8 colon-separated groups of 4 hexadecimal nibbles (four bits).  Ie, 
`fe80:0000:0000:0000:0008:987f:cef9:3d1c`.  
* Leading 0s can be ommitted - `fe80:0:0:0:8:987f:cef9:3d1c`
* Combine one or more blocks of 0s with one `::` - `fe80::8:987f:cef9:3d1c`
* Enclose in square brackets to separate from port number - `[fe80::8:987f:cef9:3d1c]:80`

Similar to IPv4, IPv6 has two parts: the network prefix and the interface ID.  Network part is always `/64` network mask.  Network part has two pieces - allocations and local subnets.

```
 Network Part          Interface ID
------------------- -------------------
fe80:0000:0000:0000:0008:987f:cef9:3d1c
-------------- ----
/48 allocations  |
               /16 for local subnets
```

Each interface has a link-local address which only works on the local network.  These start with `fe80` and is generated using `fe80::` and the MAC address for the rest of the digits.  To access a link scope address, use scope identifier (%): `ping6 fe80::8:987f:cef9:3d1c%enp0s3`

IPv6 has no broadcast address.  Multicast is used to send traffic to multiple systems.  `ping6 ff02::1%enp0s3` where 
`ff02::1` is the all-nodes link-local address.

Gather network and interface information:

* `ip link show` - lists available network interfaces
* `ip addr show enp0s3` - shows IP information for specified link
* `ip -s link show enp0s3` - shows statistics for specified link
* `ping <host_or_ip>` - checks connectivity to host.  Use `-cx` where `x` is a number to limit number of packets
* `ping6 <host_or_ip>%<interface>` - like ping but for IPv6
* `ip route` - shows IPv4 routing table.  Use `ip -6 route` for IPv6
* `tracepath <hostname>` - identify route to host through network.  `tracepath6` for IPv6.  Uses UDP by default.  `-I` for ICMP or `-T` for TCP
* `ss -ta` - socket statistics (replaces `netstat`)
* Commonly used ports listed in `/etc/services`

Configuring network interfaces:
* `nmcli dev status` - show status of all configured network devices
* `nmcli con show` - shows all connections.  Use `--active` for only active connections
* `nmcli con add` - adds a new connection
   * `nmcli con add con-name eno2 type ethernet ifname enp0s3` - uses DHCP
   * add `ipv4.address 192.168.0.5/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.0.254` - to specify IPv4 address
   * add `ipv6.address 2001:db8:0:1::c000:207/64 ipv6.gateway 2001:db8:0:1::1` for IPv6 address
* `nmcli con up con-name` - activates connection
* `nmcli dev dis <device>` - disconnects device and brings it down
* `nmcli con show con-name` - lists current settings.  Settings in lowercase are static properties.  Uppercase are temporary for this instance of connection (ie, DHCP)
* `nmcli con mod` - change settings for a connection.  See `man 5 nm-settings` for details
* `nmcli con del con-name` - deletes connection
* `nmcli gen permissions` - check permissions

Changes made using `nmcli con mod` are saved to `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<name>`.  If editing file manually run `nmcli con reload`.

* `hostname` - Displays host name 
* `hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>` - sets a new hostname
* `hostnamectl status` - Displays host name info
* `/etc/hosts` - used to convert host names to IP addresses in conjunction with DNS
* `/etc/resolv.conf` - configuration file for DNS
* `nmcli con mod` - for multi-value parameters, use `+` to add, `-` to remove, otherwise it replaces
* `host <hostname>` - tests DNS connectivity, resolves host to address
* `host <ip_address>` - reverse DNS lookup

### Labs
Labs can be run as documented.  
You may need to use a different target host when running `tracepath` since `classroom.example.com` will not be available.  
After configuring a connection with a static address, you may want to manually delete it after the lab: `nmcli con del "static-addr"`.  
When setting a hostname, you may not have a static and a transient hostname to begin with.  To set up that part of the lab, remove your current hostname: `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ""`.
