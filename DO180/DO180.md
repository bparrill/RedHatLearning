# DO180 - Introduction to Containers, Kubernetes, and Red Hat OpenShift
Several of the labs can be run from a local install of RHEL or CentOS.  This not only 
saves online lab time but allows greater flexibility in experimenting and getting
hands-on experience.

These instructions assume you have a base RHEL or CentOS system installed.  I
recommend using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to install 
an OS which can be saved or deleted as needed.

Be sure to create a shared folder with your VM so you can copy files between the
host and the VM.

## Windows Users
Here are a few items which may be of interest if you're using Windows as the host OS:
* The documentation lists long command using `\` as the line continuation character.
The line continuation character for Windows is the carat `^`

## Chapter 2
Chapter 2 is an introduction to containers using [podman](https://podman.io/).  Installation
of podman is simple:
```
sudo yum -y install podman
```
Check the status with:
```
podman info
```
The rest of chapter 2 should work as documented.  The container being pulled will come from 
one of the default repositories.  Commands to know:
```
podman run --name <name> -e <env_var>=<env_value> -d <image>:<tags> -p <fwdport>:<containerport>
podman ps
podman images
podman exec -it <container> /bin/bash
```
`-d` starts the container in the background.

To delete all containers and images:
```
podman stop -a
podman rm -a
podman rmi -a
```
Use `podman rmi -f <image>` to force delete.

## Chapter 3
This chapter continues the use of podman installed in the previous chapter.  In this chapter
we add a local installation of mysql:
```
yum install -y mysql
```
You may notice MariaDB gets installed.  This provides the `mysql` command used in this chapter.

All commands
should run as documented except in the case where the mysql script is called.  This command
will have to be executed manually.

Commands to know:
```
podman inspect <container>
podman inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <container>
podman run -it <image>:<tags> <command>
podman stop <container>
podman kill <container>
podman restart <container>
podman rm <container>
```
`-it` runs the container interactively.

To mount a shared volume:
```
podman run -v <host_dir>:<container_mount> <container>
```

To see which port has been assigned to a container:
```
podman port <container>
```

## Chapter 4
This chapter continues use of podman.  However, in section 4.4 there is a sequence of steps
where you make a change to a container, save it as a new image, and push this back to
the private registry (`registry.lab.example.com`).  

I chose to install a custom registry in a seperate VM.  You can also run it in the same VM
as your lab machine.  A number of instructions are out there [like
this one which uses Docker](https://www.linuxtechi.com/setup-docker-private-registry-centos-7-rhel-7/).
You can subsitute podman for Docker in most of these instructions.  Note:
* The registry configuration file for podman is `/etc/containers/registries.conf`
* Be sure to add your registry to both the `registries.search` and `registries.insecure`, the
latter needed if you don't enable SSL
* Be sure to include the port number.  For example:
```
[registries.insecure]
registries = ['registry.home.parrill.net:5000']

```
Commands to know:
```
podman save -o <file_name> <image_name>:<tag>
podman load -i <file_name>
```
Not recommended, but an running image can be saved in-place and saved:
```
podman commit ...
podman diff <container>
podman tag
podman push
```
## Chapter 5
We can continue using our installed podman for most of these instructions.  

In the guided exercise for section 5.4 you create a Dockerfile.  You'll need
to create your own directory first.  Also, we don't have a custom yum repository
so don't add (or comment out) the line:
```
ADD training.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/training.repo
```

Also, if using CentOS be sure to use the CentOS base image instead of Red Hat:
```
FROM centos:7.5.1804
```

The lab for section 5.5 has you do some edits to an existing Dockerfile
provided by the lab.  TO_DO: recreate this Dockerfile.

## Chapter 6
This chapter introduces OpenShift.  You can set up 
[minishift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview) if you don't want
to install a full-blown OpenShift environment.  Before continuing, download and
install the Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) which provides a minishift 
environment.  Perform the 
[Hello World](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/hello-world) 
exercise to verify your minishift environment is working.

The rest of these instructions assume minishift has been installed and started.  
When started successfully you should see something like this:
```
Server Information ...
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.99.100:8443/console

You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: <any value>

Be sure to also update your environment so that the `oc` command is available.  
Instructions are provided with the CDK documentation.

To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin
```
You will be using *admin* to log on as administrator as opposed to *kubeadmin* which
is documented in the instructions. For example, to log in:
```
oc login -u admin -p admin https://192.168.99.100:8443
```
The URL including the port will be displayed when minishift has started.  To find
this information later use:
```
oc config view
```

`oc` commands will be executed from your host system - not the VM we've been 
primarily using to this point.

### MySql
A local copy of [Mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) can also be installed.
You may also be able to use the mysql already installed in your VM, however, 
you'll probably need to do some extra configuration and opening of ports on the host
firewall.
Also check out the open source version of MySql called [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).
You may use the Windows installer version (`.msi`) or just download the `zip` file and 
unpack it into a directory.  I chose the latter and put the files in the same directory 
as Minishift.

### Section 6.4 Lab
This lab runs as documented with the following exceptions:
* Log in using the procedure above
* The `registry.lab.example.com` system isn't available.  `mysql` is
available in several places.  Minishift is configured with some standard image
repositories.  Try the `new-app` command without specifying the full URL to
pull an image:
```
oc new-app --docker-image=rhscl/mysql-57-rhel7:latest ....
```
or to use a CentOS based image (recommended if your system isn't registered to Red Hat):
```
oc new-app --docker-image=centos/mysql-57-centos7:latest --name=mysql-openshift ^
-e MYSQL_USER=user1 -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypa55 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=testdb ^
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=r00tpa55
```
* You can omit the `--insecure-registry=true` parameter if using one of the official
repositories

In step 4.1 you are supposed to run the `oc port-forward` command which will lock 
up your command prompt.  In Windows use:
```
start oc port-forward ...
```
so that you can continue using your command prompt.  `oc` will start in a separate
window.

### Section 6.6 Lab
This lab uses a very basic PHP application normally served by the lab services server.
There's no shortage of Helloworld applications so choose any of the basic ones you 
can find.  I've provided one as well:
```
oc new-app php:5.6~http://github.com/bparrill/php-helloworld
```
Note, however, that in the next lab you'll be making modifications to the code and
pushing it back to git, so you may want to create your own helloworld repository.

Steps 4 and 5 have you expose the service and then make a request.  Sometimes it may
take a few minutes for the route to become active.  If  you get a `Could not resolve
host: ...` error wait a few minutes and try again:
```
C:\minishift>oc expose svc/php-helloworld
route.route.openshift.io/php-helloworld exposed

C:\minishift>oc describe route
Name:                   php-helloworld
Namespace:              route
Created:                8 seconds ago
Labels:                 app=php-helloworld
Annotations:            openshift.io/host.generated=true
Requested Host:         php-helloworld-route.192.168.99.100.nip.io
                          exposed on router router 8 seconds ago
Path:                   <none>
TLS Termination:        <none>
Insecure Policy:        <none>
Endpoint Port:          8080-tcp

Service:        php-helloworld
Weight:         100 (100%)
Endpoints:      172.17.0.11:8443, 172.17.0.11:8080

C:\minishift>curl php-helloworld-route.192.168.99.100.nip.io
curl: (6) Could not resolve host: php-helloworld-route.192.168.99.100.nip.io

C:\minishift>curl php-helloworld-route.192.168.99.100.nip.io
<p>Hello World</p>
```

Commands to know:
```
oc get pods -w
oc logs -f bc/php-helloworld
oc logs -f dc/php-helloworld
oc describe svc/php-helloworld
oc expose svc/php-helloworld
```

### Section 6.8 Lab
The first part of this lab has you look at some source code.  Luckily that code isn't used in the
lab itself.

The lab also makes use of Git.  If you don't have it already installed you will need it.  Windows
users may want to check out [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Windows users: be aware that Windows requires double-quotes on the command line, ie:
```
git commit -m "Updated file"
```
In step 5.4, `git commit` may not automatically update the remote code repository.  To push the code back
to your repository:
```
git push origin master
```
You'll be prompted for your Github userID and password.

### Section 6.10 Lab
This lab uses the OpenShift web console.  

The URL for starting the console is displayed when minishift starts:
```
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.99.100:8443/console

You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: <any value>

To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin
```
Alternatively you may use the minishift command to open the console:
```
minishift console
```
or to display the URL:
```
minishift console --url
```
The screens for Minishift will look different than the ones in the lab so you may need
to hunt around for some of the information.

### Section 6.11 Lab
This lab has you install a temperature converter app.  I used:
```
https://github.com/Goatella/PHPTemperatureConversion
```
Be sure to give the service a shorter name if you use the example above.  Such as:
```
oc expose --name temps svc/phptemperatureconversion
```
If your application is not named `index.php` then you'll need to specify the name in 
the URL:
```
http://temps-ocp.192.168.99.100.nip.io/convert.php
```
